/* padding increases the space between the border of a box and the content of the box.
margin increases the space between the borders of a box and the borders of adjacent boxes.
border adds space (even if itâ€™s only a pixel or two) between the margin and the padding. */

Flexbox notes:
once you give a container (like a div) a property: Display:flex;
you then have control over it's children
by default - the flex direction is set to row (horizontal)
Cross axis runs vertically
if you add a container with a fixed width - by default it will sit in the top left
this is because the main axis starts at the left and the top

Say you have 3 children containers with a fixed width within 1 parent:
The amount of space these take up is called the 'main size'
if you change the item's width to 100%, flexbox will distribute the
3 containers equally along the entire page (33% Each)

Use Justify content to space evenly or push elements to the flex ends
use align to align (align:center)


if you set the flex direction to Collum like so: flex-direction:collum;
then everything will work the same but be shown horizontal and the cross will now be vertical
